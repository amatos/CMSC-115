    Chapter 8 Project 3:

    (Locate the largest element)
    Write the following method that returns the location of the largest element in a two-dimensional array.
    public static int[] locateLargest(double[][] a)
    The return value is a one-dimensional array that contains two elements. These two elements indicate the
    row and column indices of the largest element in the two-dimensional array. If there are more than one
    largest element, return the smallest row index and then the smallest column index.
    Write a test program that prompts the user to enter a two-dimensional array and displays the location
    of the largest element in the array.

    Sample Run
    Enter the number of rows and columns of the array: 3 4
    Enter the array:
    23.5 35 2 10
    4.5 3 45 3.5
    35 44 5.5 9.6
    The location of the largest element is at (1, 2)
