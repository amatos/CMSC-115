/*
(The Rectangle class)
Following the example of the Circle class in Section 9.2, design a class named Rectangle to represent a rectangle.
The class contains:
- Two double data fields named width and height that specify the width and height of the rectangle. The default values are 1 for both width and height.
- A no-arg constructor that creates a default rectangle.
- A constructor that creates a rectangle with the specified width and height.
- A method named getArea() that returns the area of this rectangle.
- A method named getPerimeter() that returns the perimeter.
Draw the UML diagram for the class and then implement the class.
Write a test program that creates two Rectangle objectsâ€”one with width 4 and height 40 and the other with width 3.5 and height 35.9.
Display the width, height, area, and perimeter of each rectangle in this order.

Sample Run
The area of a rectangle with width 4.0 and height 40.0 is 160.0
The perimeter of a rectangle is 88.0
The area of a rectangle with width 3.5 and height 35.9 is 125.64999999999999
The perimeter of a rectangle is 78.8
